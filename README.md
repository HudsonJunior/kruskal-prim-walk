# Kruskal-Prim-Walk

This project implements algorithms to find paths in a graph using **RandomKruskal**, **RandomPrim**, or **RandomWalk** methods. Given a graph with `n` vertices, the program explores various techniques for generating minimum spanning trees and graph traversal paths.

## Features

- **Algorithms**: Implements RandomKruskal, RandomPrim, and RandomWalk.
- **Graph Traversal**: Provides pathfinding and tree construction for any given graph.

This project is useful for exploring and comparing different pathfinding and graph algorithms.
